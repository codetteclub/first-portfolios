# How to submit your portfolio:
  1. Make sure your portfolio is hosted. We recommend you host with Github pages or Firebase. [Github pages is easy and free](https://pages.github.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart) is also good for quickly deploying a website. Host your first portfolio with one of these methods separately from your professional portfolio so it can stay the same indefinitely and remain a point of comparison to all the new things you will accomplish! You will also be able to add a link to your current portfolio to easily compare.
  2. Grab the link to your first portfolio.
  3. Fork the [repository for the project](https://github.com/codetteclub/first-portfolios).
Now that you have the link to your portfolio, you will need to fork the repository for the project.
You will start at https://github.com/codetteclub/first-portfolios. At the upper-right of the screen, click the button that says “fork”. Follow this template to create a file with your portfolio information:
```
{
	"name": "YOUR NAME HERE",
	"oldURL": "http://www.YOURFIRSTPORTFOLIOURLHERE.com",
	"newURL": "http://www.YOURNEWPORTFOLIOURLHERE.com"
}
```
save this file as `YOURNAME.js` within the portfolios folder in your fork of the repository. Once you have committed the new file, you will be ready to start your pull request!
Commit your file to the portfolios folder within your fork of the project.
  4. Submit your pull request! Go to the master repository and select the button that says “New pull request.”
The Compare Changes page will load, and you will need to select “compare across forks.” The base fork should be the master repository, the head fork will the version that you are submitting. Click the green “Create pull request” button.
On the next page you will need to fill in at least the title, and optionally add more information about your pull request. A title describing your filename will be plenty of info for this contribution. Once you have filled in that information, you can click the next green “Create pull request” button.
  5. That’s it! Now just relax and wait for your submission to be merged!



Woohoo! You did it! Go you!
